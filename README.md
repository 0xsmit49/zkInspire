# Introduction

This is our [pitch deck](https://zkinspire-sfyjz8d.gamma.site/)

This is our [technical documentation](https://smits-organization-1.gitbook.io/zkinspire/)

**zkInspire** introduces **Proof of Inspiration** a zero-knowledge-powered protocol that lets creators **provably link their work to prior creations** without exposing the details. This enables **automatic inspiration royalties** and builds an **onchain graph of creative influence**. Powered by **Zora CoinV4** and integrated with Uniswap V4 liquidity, **zkInspire** makes creative credit provable, private, and profitable.

## What it is:
An on-chain registry where creators commit hashes of their work upfront → then, any future work (articles, songs, memes, videos) can provably show they derived from that original work using zk-proofs of similarity/inspiration.

## Key:

If your meme or song inspired someone else → you get automatically paid a percentage if they prove derivation via zk.

Inspired creators prove derivation to credibly build on prior art — but without revealing full creative path or identity.

## ZK Role:

Prove derivative relationships → without revealing what parts, what influence, or personal connections.

# Problem Statement

In today’s digital creator economy, inspiration is everywhere but rarely rewarded. Writers remix articles, musicians sample beats, meme creators iterate on viral content but original creators receive little or no credit or compensation. Worse, proving that a work was genuinely inspired by another is nearly impossible without revealing private drafts, sources, or creative secrets.

There is no standardized, provable way to link creative works together especially in a way that ensures automatic revenue sharing with upstream creators.

## Royalty Flow with Uniswap Integration

1. **X% Royalty** → Sent to parent creators (based on DAG depth & declared splits).
2. **Y% Platform Fee** → Converted to \$ZORA via Uniswap.
3. **Referrer Cut** → Routed to referrer wallet.
4. **Remaining Royalties** → Direct payout to remix creator in \$ETH or \$ZORA.

**Royalty Splitting Example:**

```plaintext
Royalty: 10%
 → 5% → Immediate parent creator
 → 2% → Ancestors (depth-based)
 → 2% → Platform (swapped to $ZORA)
 → 1% → Referrer (if any)
```

# 5. Proof of Inspiration (PoI)

## 5.1 Formal Definition

**Proof of Inspiration (PoI)** is a **zero-knowledge attestable cryptographic primitive** that enables a creator to **commit to and prove linkage between a newly minted creative asset and an existing work** without disclosing sensitive relationships. It introduces **programmable attribution guarantees** at the protocol level while preserving creator privacy.

Formally:

Given:

* Original Work Identifier: `H_o = keccak256(URI_o || metadata)`
* New Work: `W_n`
* Commitment: `C_poi = H(H_o || PK_creator || salt)`
* zk-Proof: `π ∈ ZK{ knows (H_o, salt) : C_poi = H(H_o || PK_creator || salt) }`

where:

* `PK_creator` = Creator’s onchain public key
* `H_o` = Hash of the prior work (can be IPFS CID, ENS, or NFT ID)
* `π` = Zero-knowledge proof binding the new work to the original

The **ZoraFactory deploy hook** verifies `π` to activate attribution-dependent mechanisms.

---

## 5.2 Protocol Components

### 5.2.1 Hash Commitment Scheme

* Hash Algorithm: `keccak256`
* Inputs: `(originalWorkIdentifier, creatorPublicKey, salt)`
* Purpose: **Non-malleable binding** of inspiration source to a specific creator, preventing substitution or replay attacks.

### 5.2.2 zk-SNARK Circuit

* Circuit: `PoI_Circuit`
* Inputs:

  * Public: `C_poi`
  * Private: `(H_o, salt)`
* Statement Proven:

  > *“I know an original work `H_o` such that `C_poi = H(H_o || PK_creator || salt)`”*
* zk System: Groth16 or Plonk
* Proof Size: \~200 bytes (Groth16); Verification gas: \~200k–400k depending on optimization

### 5.2.3 Onchain Verifier Contract

* Verifies proof validity.
* Emits `InspirationLinked(original, derived, commitment)` event for graph construction.
* Interfaces with the **PostDeployHook** on `ZoraFactory` to activate downstream effects.

## 5.3 Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant ZoraFactory
  participant PoI_Verifier
  participant UniswapV4Pool

  User->>User: Generate inspiration hash H_o
  User->>User: Generate zkProof π for H_o
  User->>ZoraFactory: deployCoin(payout, owners, ..., C_poi, π)
  ZoraFactory->>PoI_Verifier: verifyProof(C_poi, π)
  PoI_Verifier-->>ZoraFactory: Valid
  ZoraFactory->>UniswapV4Pool: Create liquidity pool
  ZoraFactory-->>User: Coin deployed with Proof of Inspiration
```

---

## 5.4 Economic Integration

* **Royalty Splits**: `PoI_RoyaltyRouter` enforces dynamic `x%` streaming to `originalWorkOwner` on every trade.
* **Inspiration Weighting**: `w_i ∈ [0,1]` → proportional attribution weight (configurable via postDeployHookData).
* **Recursive Inspiration Graphs**: Supports **multi-hop inspiration lineage**, traceable via event logs and onchain graph indexers.

# 6 Tokenomics & Royalties

## 6.1 Royalty Calculation Model

Royalties for **derivative works** (remixes/inspired creations) are **programmatically enforced** via **onchain logic** embedded in minting contracts.

### **Royalty Formula:**

For any derivative content **Cₙ** inspired by parent **Cₙ₋₁**:

$$
\text{Royalty}(Cₙ) = P \cdot S(Cₙ₋₁) \cdot R(Cₙ₋₁)
$$

Where:

| Symbol      | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P**       | Sale price of derivative content                            |
| **S(Cₙ₋₁)** | Royalty share in **Basis Points (BP)**, set by parent node  |
| **R(Cₙ₋₁)** | Reputation Multiplier (1.0 → 2.0) for incentivized creators |

---

### Example:

| Parameter             | Value       |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **Sale Price (P)**    | 1.0 ETH     |
| **Royalty Share (S)** | 300 BP → 3% |
| **Reputation Mult.**  | 1.2         |
| → **Royalty Paid**    | 0.036 ETH   |

---

## 6.2 Multi-Hop Royalty Splitting (Recursive)

For deep remix chains, **recursive royalty calculation** applies proportionally:

$$
\text{Royalty}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^d (P \cdot S(C_i) \cdot R(C_i))
$$

* **Depth (d)** → Number of ancestor nodes in DAG.
* **Recursive Cap** → Set via governance; e.g., **max 3 hops** to avoid infinite recursion or micro-distributions.

### Onchain Example Flow:

```plaintext
Derivative NFT Sale → Contract → Traverses DAG → Splits payout to:
  - Immediate Parent(s)
  - Ancestor Nodes (if depth > 1)
  - Platform Fee Recipient
```

---

## 6.3 Role Responsibilities

| Role                 | Responsibility                                      | Reward Structure                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Original Creator** | Right to set `royaltyShareBP` in minted metadata    | Receives upstream royalties from remixes    |
| **Inspired Creator** | Must declare `declaredInspiration=true` if remixing | Royalty from their own derivative sales     |
| **Fraud Detectors**  | Can submit fraud claims with proof                  | Receives **bounty** upon confirmation (DAO) |

---

## 6.4 Incentive Mechanisms

### 6.4.1 Platform Fees (Protocol Sustainability)

* Flat platform fee (e.g., **2.5%** of sale) directed to protocol treasury DAO.
* Can be redirected to staking pools for creators → **yield on creative work**.

### 6.4.2 Referrer Bonuses

* Referrals tracked via ephemeral **referral tokens** signed with **EIP-712 signatures**.
* Referrer receives **1–3%** of transaction volume depending on activity tier.

```plaintext
[User Clicks Referral Link] → Generates ephemeral EIP-712 Signature → Used at Checkout → Referrer Paid
```

---

## 6.5 Implementation: Solidity Architecture

```solidity
struct RoyaltySplit {
    address payable recipient;
    uint16 shareBP;
    uint8 depth;
    bytes32 inspirationId;
}
```

### Payout Function Flow:

```solidity
function distributeRoyalty(uint256 salePrice, RoyaltySplit[] calldata splits) external payable {
    for (uint i = 0; i < splits.length; i++) {
        uint256 amount = (salePrice * splits[i].shareBP) / 10000;
        (bool success, ) = splits[i].recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Royalty transfer failed");
    }
}
```

* **EIP-2981 Compatible** → Royalty standard compliant for cross-platform support.
* **Upgradeable Architecture** → Supports governance-controlled changes to recursion limits or BP ranges.
