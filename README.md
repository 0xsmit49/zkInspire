# Introduction


**zkInspire** introduces **Proof of Inspiration** a zero-knowledge-powered protocol that lets creators **provably link their work to prior creations** without exposing the details. This enables **automatic inspiration royalties** and builds an **onchain graph of creative influence**. Powered by **Zora CoinV4** and integrated with Uniswap V4 liquidity, **zkInspire** makes creative credit provable, private, and profitable.

## What it is:
An on-chain registry where creators commit hashes of their work upfront → then, any future work (articles, songs, memes, videos) can provably show they derived from that original work using zk-proofs of similarity/inspiration.

## Key:

If your meme or song inspired someone else → you get automatically paid a percentage if they prove derivation via zk.

Inspired creators prove derivation to credibly build on prior art — but without revealing full creative path or identity.

## ZK Role:

Prove derivative relationships → without revealing what parts, what influence, or personal connections.

# Problem Statement

In today’s digital creator economy, inspiration is everywhere but rarely rewarded. Writers remix articles, musicians sample beats, meme creators iterate on viral content but original creators receive little or no credit or compensation. Worse, proving that a work was genuinely inspired by another is nearly impossible without revealing private drafts, sources, or creative secrets.

There is no standardized, provable way to link creative works together especially in a way that ensures automatic revenue sharing with upstream creators.

### 3. **No Privacy-Preserving Proof Mechanism Exists**

* **Source:** [zkSummit - "Privacy in Creative Proof Systems" (2024)](https://zksummit.com/)

  > Argues that **proving inspiration or derivation typically requires exposing sensitive data (drafts, sources, references)**—a clear violation of creative privacy and IP protection norms.

* **Source:** [Electric Coin Company - "Zero-Knowledge for Data Privacy" (2023)](https://electriccoin.co/)

  > Shows that **zk-proofs enable verifiable statements without revealing sensitive details**, yet **no system currently applies zk-proofs to the creative derivative space.**

### 4. **Missing Integration with Onchain Royalty Systems**

* **Source:** [Uniswap Foundation - "Composable Liquidity for Creator Economies" (2024)](https://uniswap.org/blog/composable-liquidity)

  > Highlights that **royalty enforcement is fragmented**, with no standard to **link derivative coins (e.g., Zora CoinV4) with originator revenue streams** programmatically.

* **Source:** [Zora - "Native Royalty Splitting in CoinV4" (2024)](https://zora.co/protocol/coins)

  > Notes that **Zora CoinV4 supports royalty routing but lacks integration with cryptographically provable inspiration chains**, making it difficult to automate downstream revenue splits.

# Solution Statement

zkInspire introduces Proof of Inspiration, a privacy-preserving, onchain verification system for creative works using zero-knowledge proofs. It allows creators to cryptographically prove that a new work was inspired by an existing one without revealing sensitive details of the creative process. This system automatically enforces royalty splits in protocols Zora CoinV4 and Uniswap, aligning attribution with onchain incentives while preserving creator privacy.


---

## 1. Verifiable Proof of Inspiration with Zero-Knowledge Privacy

zkInspire introduces **Proof of Inspiration**, a cryptographic mechanism that allows creators to **prove influence from prior works** without exposing sensitive drafts or creative processes.

By generating **zero-knowledge proofs of derivation**, creators can declare inspiration **onchain**, enabling **automatic attribution and revenue-sharing** enforced at the protocol level.

Inspiration becomes not just social credit—it’s **provable, enforceable, and rewarded**.

---

## 2. Onchain Royalty Splits for Derivative Works

With zkInspire’s integration into **Zora CoinV4 minting flows**, each derivative work can carry **embedded revenue-sharing logic**, sending a portion of royalties back to the origin creator automatically.

No need for trust, negotiations, or third-party platforms—**royalty splits are enforced by smart contracts**, making remix culture sustainable and creator-friendly.

**Every new idea strengthens the original creator’s financial foundation.**

---

## 3. zk-Based Inspiration Graph for Ecosystem Intelligence

All relationships between original works and their derivatives form an **onchain, cryptographically verifiable inspiration graph**, **preserving privacy while enabling powerful ecosystem analytics**.

Fans, collectors, and curators can trace the lineage of creative works, surfacing **high-value originators** while still respecting creator privacy.

**The creator economy finally gains a structured, provable creative graph.**

---

## 4. Seamless Integration with Zora and Uniswap for Market Liquidity

By aligning **Proof of Inspiration** directly with **Zora’s CoinV4 contracts** and **Uniswap liquidity pools**, zkInspire ensures that **derivative works and their coins are automatically tradable** with embedded royalty flows.

This makes creative attribution directly tied to **liquid, onchain market incentives**, bringing sustainable economics to the remix era.

**zkInspire transforms creative influence into provable, liquid value.**

# 5. Proof of Inspiration (PoI)

## 5.1 Formal Definition

**Proof of Inspiration (PoI)** is a **zero-knowledge attestable cryptographic primitive** that enables a creator to **commit to and prove linkage between a newly minted creative asset and an existing work** without disclosing sensitive relationships. It introduces **programmable attribution guarantees** at the protocol level while preserving creator privacy.

Formally:

Given:

* Original Work Identifier: `H_o = keccak256(URI_o || metadata)`
* New Work: `W_n`
* Commitment: `C_poi = H(H_o || PK_creator || salt)`
* zk-Proof: `π ∈ ZK{ knows (H_o, salt) : C_poi = H(H_o || PK_creator || salt) }`

where:

* `PK_creator` = Creator’s onchain public key
* `H_o` = Hash of the prior work (can be IPFS CID, ENS, or NFT ID)
* `π` = Zero-knowledge proof binding the new work to the original

The **ZoraFactory deploy hook** verifies `π` to activate attribution-dependent mechanisms.

---

## 5.2 Protocol Components

### 5.2.1 Hash Commitment Scheme

* Hash Algorithm: `keccak256`
* Inputs: `(originalWorkIdentifier, creatorPublicKey, salt)`
* Purpose: **Non-malleable binding** of inspiration source to a specific creator, preventing substitution or replay attacks.

### 5.2.2 zk-SNARK Circuit

* Circuit: `PoI_Circuit`
* Inputs:

  * Public: `C_poi`
  * Private: `(H_o, salt)`
* Statement Proven:

  > *“I know an original work `H_o` such that `C_poi = H(H_o || PK_creator || salt)`”*
* zk System: Groth16 or Plonk
* Proof Size: \~200 bytes (Groth16); Verification gas: \~200k–400k depending on optimization

### 5.2.3 Onchain Verifier Contract

* Verifies proof validity.
* Emits `InspirationLinked(original, derived, commitment)` event for graph construction.
* Interfaces with the **PostDeployHook** on `ZoraFactory` to activate downstream effects.

  PoI_Verifier-->>ZoraFactory: Valid
  ZoraFactory->>UniswapV4Pool: Create liquidity pool
  ZoraFactory-->>User: Coin deployed with Proof of Inspiration
```

---

## 5.4 Economic Integration

* **Royalty Splits**: `PoI_RoyaltyRouter` enforces dynamic `x%` streaming to `originalWorkOwner` on every trade.
* **Inspiration Weighting**: `w_i ∈ [0,1]` → proportional attribution weight (configurable via postDeployHookData).
* **Recursive Inspiration Graphs**: Supports **multi-hop inspiration lineage**, traceable via event logs and onchain graph indexers.

# 6 Tokenomics & Royalties

## 6.1 Royalty Calculation Model

Royalties for **derivative works** (remixes/inspired creations) are **programmatically enforced** via **onchain logic** embedded in minting contracts.

### **Royalty Formula:**

For any derivative content **Cₙ** inspired by parent **Cₙ₋₁**:

$$
\text{Royalty}(Cₙ) = P \cdot S(Cₙ₋₁) \cdot R(Cₙ₋₁)
$$

Where:

| Symbol      | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P**       | Sale price of derivative content                            |
| **S(Cₙ₋₁)** | Royalty share in **Basis Points (BP)**, set by parent node  |
| **R(Cₙ₋₁)** | Reputation Multiplier (1.0 → 2.0) for incentivized creators |

---

### Example:

| Parameter             | Value       |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **Sale Price (P)**    | 1.0 ETH     |
| **Royalty Share (S)** | 300 BP → 3% |
| **Reputation Mult.**  | 1.2         |
| → **Royalty Paid**    | 0.036 ETH   |

---

## 6.2 Multi-Hop Royalty Splitting (Recursive)

For deep remix chains, **recursive royalty calculation** applies proportionally:

$$
\text{Royalty}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^d (P \cdot S(C_i) \cdot R(C_i))
$$

* **Depth (d)** → Number of ancestor nodes in DAG.
* **Recursive Cap** → Set via governance; e.g., **max 3 hops** to avoid infinite recursion or micro-distributions.

### Onchain Example Flow:

```plaintext
Derivative NFT Sale → Contract → Traverses DAG → Splits payout to:
  - Immediate Parent(s)
  - Ancestor Nodes (if depth > 1)
  - Platform Fee Recipient
```

---

## 6.3 Role Responsibilities

| Role                 | Responsibility                                      | Reward Structure                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Original Creator** | Right to set `royaltyShareBP` in minted metadata    | Receives upstream royalties from remixes    |
| **Inspired Creator** | Must declare `declaredInspiration=true` if remixing | Royalty from their own derivative sales     |
| **Fraud Detectors**  | Can submit fraud claims with proof                  | Receives **bounty** upon confirmation (DAO) |

---

## 6.4 Incentive Mechanisms

### 6.4.1 Platform Fees (Protocol Sustainability)

* Flat platform fee (e.g., **2.5%** of sale) directed to protocol treasury DAO.
* Can be redirected to staking pools for creators → **yield on creative work**.

### 6.4.2 Referrer Bonuses

* Referrals tracked via ephemeral **referral tokens** signed with **EIP-712 signatures**.
* Referrer receives **1–3%** of transaction volume depending on activity tier.

```plaintext
[User Clicks Referral Link] → Generates ephemeral EIP-712 Signature → Used at Checkout → Referrer Paid
```

---

## 6.5 Implementation: Solidity Architecture

```solidity
struct RoyaltySplit {
    address payable recipient;
    uint16 shareBP;
    uint8 depth;
    bytes32 inspirationId;
}
```

### Payout Function Flow:

```solidity
function distributeRoyalty(uint256 salePrice, RoyaltySplit[] calldata splits) external payable {
    for (uint i = 0; i < splits.length; i++) {
        uint256 amount = (salePrice * splits[i].shareBP) / 10000;
        (bool success, ) = splits[i].recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Royalty transfer failed");
    }
}
```

* **EIP-2981 Compatible** → Royalty standard compliant for cross-platform support.
* **Upgradeable Architecture** → Supports governance-controlled changes to recursion limits or BP ranges.
